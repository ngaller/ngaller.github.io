{"name":"Nic Galler","tagline":"Programmer","body":"### About Me\r\n\r\nI am Nic Galler, `ngaller`, `nicocrm`, `nico_g` or even `Chive` for those old enough to have met me on IRC in the 2000's.\r\n\r\n### What I Do\r\n\r\nI write programs and web sites.  I like to try a bit of everything but I am best with API integration and front-end logic.  I love C#, Javascript, PHP and also dabble with Ruby and Python from time to time.  I work mostly with InforCRM, Salesforce and Wordpress, using Angular, jQuery and dojo on the front-end.\r\n\r\n### What A Geek!\r\n\r\nI also enjoy gardening and cooking.  I love experimenting with recipes to find the right combination and know better than to follow a recipe to the letter (this is not unlike the way I program, come to think of it).  I make my own yogurt and sauerkraut (this may not help with the Geek factor).  I am an avid cyclist though a leg injury is keeping me from the bike right now.  When I am not doing any of that I am probably goofing around with my 2 1/2 year old son.\r\n\r\n### My Stuff\r\n\r\n * [Github](https://github.com/ngaller)\r\n * [CoderWall](https://coderwall.com/nico_g)\r\n * [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ngaller)\r\n * [Blog](http://www.xtivia.com/author/ngallerxtivia-com/)\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\n\r\n * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicogaller)\r\n * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicoGaller)\r\n * [Email](mailto:ngaller@gmail.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
